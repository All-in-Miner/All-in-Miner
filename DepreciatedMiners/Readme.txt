Readme for Depreciated Miners

The miner.ps1 files in this folder can be used with All-in-Miner.
However, they are not included by default in the miner folder as there are alreay new versions of these miners.

To enable one of thes, copy miner.ps1 into the ".\miners\" folder.

Please let us know on github if any older miner version works better than a new version.
